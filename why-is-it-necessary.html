            <p><strong>why is it necessary</strong> to reflect the
immanent absoluteness of the proletariat after demonstrating its generic
being and thinking its singular existence? ostensibly, to guard against
any finitising genealogy.</p>
<p>however, the doctrine of resurrection in <em>Logics of
Worlds</em>—which serves the double function of</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>witnessing the univocity of truth (its integral transmissibility
across worlds)</li>
<li>exhausting the previous sequence of truth (</li>
</ol>
<p>—seems to satisfy the categorical–systemic requirements Badiou
imposes on absolutisation in <em>Immanence of Truths</em>.</p>
<p>moreover, resurrection plays this role without repeating the bind
(self-)attributed to the element of décalage in <em>Being and
Event</em>; in which the pursuit of an account of the being of truth
that maintains its intelligibility <strong>and</strong> its subtraction
from state remains too abstract with regards to conjunctural thinking,
or thought–practice.</p>
<hr />
<p>Badiou writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10. Every work is universal in that, owing to its evental origins, it
is a partial exception to the laws of the world in which it appears.
This universality is attested to ontologically by the fact that
constitutes the being of a work is a generic multiple…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… It is attested to phenomenologically by the fact that a work,
inasmuch as it is universal, can come back to life in worlds other than
the one in which it was created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here lies the problem.</p>
<p>The reason this upends the closure of Badiou’s discourse upon itself
which, after the phenomenological adventurism of <em>Logics of
Worlds</em>, wants to swing back towards the ontological is that the
coming ‘back to life’ in worlds</p>
<p>elaborates</p>
<p>Or, if you’re feeling combative, theology and soteriology.</p>

<p>But <em>what is resurrected</em> is <em>not</em> the work, but the
Idea. Each mundane pursuit of truth by a subject constitutes a work, but
the regularity of the resurrections is the Idea.</p>
<p>But what is the Idea? It is the scheme whereby we enter into the
truth from a state of mere veridigality.</p>
<p>and what we find is the generically human. Which is in fact what we
do, it is the one life of the person.</p>
<hr />
<p>Communist politics has always been determined, or filled and emptied
out, by its resurrection in new worlds.</p>
